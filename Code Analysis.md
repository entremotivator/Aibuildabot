## Code Analysis

### OpenAI API Integration

- The application initializes the OpenAI client in the `initialize_openai` function, retrieving the API key from Streamlit secrets or environment variables.
- The core interaction with the OpenAI API happens in the `chat_with_agent` function, which uses `openai.chat.completions.create` to generate responses from the `gpt-4` model.
- The function constructs a message history including a system prompt (defined by `get_agent_prompt`), the user's message, and recent chat history for context.

### Bot Personalities

- The `BOT_PERSONALITIES` dictionary is a hardcoded data structure that defines the various AI agents available in the toolkit.
- Each agent has a name, description, emoji, category, temperature setting, a list of specialties, and a list of quick actions.
- This structure is static and does not currently support user-defined or dynamically created bots.

### Streamlit Application Structure

- The application is a single Python script (`ai_agent_toolkit.py`) that runs as a Streamlit app.
- The `main` function acts as the entry point, checking for user authentication and then displaying either the `login_form` or the main application interface (`display_sidebar` and `display_chat_interface`).
- The application is currently single-page. To add more pages, we will need to implement a multi-page structure, likely using a dictionary of functions that represent different pages and a selector in the sidebar to switch between them.

### Personalization

- The current application has limited personalization. It stores chat history in the user's session, but there is no mechanism for users to create their own custom bots or save their preferences.
- To add personalization, we will need to:
    1.  Create a way for users to define their own bot personalities (e.g., through a form).
    2.  Store these custom bot configurations, likely associated with the user's ID (from Supabase).
    3.  Load and use these custom bots in the chat interface.
    4.  Potentially store chat history more persistently (e.g., in Supabase) to maintain conversations across sessions.
